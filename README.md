## What it does.
Our application allows small businesses to register, After registration our system generates for them a fully functional ecomerce which they use to post and sell their products to clients. When a client opens our system, the system will fetch his/her current location and point to all businesses around him/her. The system will also display the goods and services sold by those nearby businesses.

## Technologies used.
We used HTML, CSS,JS and Django as our application is crrently running on the browser but we are in the process of developing an android application for it. Django is responsible for service our clients request. and to the system we attached `Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible servers` which makes processing of data easier. In addition we also used `Azure app services` whichruns our entire aplication and it is attached to our github repository.

## Challenges
Some of the challenges that we are still currently facing is that our system requires intergration with payments methods such as M-Pesa Paybill or MPesa Till number as we are still currently testing with Kenya which we were still not able to register.
